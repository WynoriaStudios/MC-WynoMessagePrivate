# MC-WynoMessagePrivate
**WynoMessagePrivate** is a Script (with [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) Plugin) allows Minecraft players to send private messages to other players.

This script has been tested on the Minecraft version **1.21.8** with **PAPER**.

We're using Skript version **2.12.2**, but in the future we'll be using the **latest patch update** from the **latest major Skript update**.

You can download the script on the [**release page**](https://github.com/WynoriaStudios/MC-WynoMessagePrivate/releases). Each update may contain new features, bug fixes and feature enhancements.

You can modify the code as you wish, but it is prohibited to upload the **default code**. We will require immediate removal of your resource by the moderation of the upload platform.
