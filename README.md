# MC-WynoMessagePrivate
**WynoMessagePrivate** is a Script (with Skript Plugin) allows Minecraft players to send private messages to other players.

This script has been tested on the Minecraft version **1.21.4** with **PAPER**. We will only test the latest minor version of the game when **PAPER** is stable enough to test it.

We're using Skript version **2.10.2**, but in the future we'll be using the **latest patch update** from the **latest major Skript update**. (For example, we've been waiting for the **latest update** to **major Skript version 2.11**).
